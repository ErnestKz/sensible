## Instructions
The main configurations available for demo are:
- To run this program as multiple nodes on the same machine. This config aims to demonstrate interactive shell and the ability to inspect and operate on the data that a node has received from other nodes.
- To run the program as a single node intended to communicate across the network. This config demonstrates the ability for nodes (in this case Raspberry Pis) to communicate across a network.

### Multiple Nodes on Single Machine: The Interactive Shell

### Single Node: Communication Across Network
