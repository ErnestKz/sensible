## Instructions
The main configurations available for demo are:
- To run this program as multiple nodes on the same machine. This config aims to demonstrate the ability to inspect the data that a node has recieved from other nodes and other control plane functionalities (via the built in Interactive Shell).
- To run the program as a single node intended to communicate across the network. This config demonstrates the ability for a node to communicate across the network.

### Multiple Nodes on Single Machine: The Interactive Shell

### Single Node: Communication Across Network
